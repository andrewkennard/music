Sleigh bells ring
Are you listenin'?
In the lane
Snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town"

Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

, Are ya listenin'?
(In the lane), Snow is glissin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in the winter wonderland

Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
(We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman)
Yes, until the other kidies knock him down

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
