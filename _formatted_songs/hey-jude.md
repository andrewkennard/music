[Verse 1]<br>
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad<br>
Take a sad song and make it better<br>
Remember to let her into your heart<br>
Then you can start to make it better<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Hey, Jude, don't be afraid<br>
You were made to go out and get her<br>
The minute you let her under your skin<br>
Then you begin to make it better<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
And anytime you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain<br>
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders<br>
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br>
By making his world a little colder<br>
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Hey, Jude, don't let me down<br>
You have found her, now go and get her<br>
(Let it out and let it in)<br>
Remember (Hey, Jude) to let her into your heart<br>
Then you can start to make it better<br>
You might also like<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
So let it out and let it in, hey, Jude, begin<br>
You're waiting for someone to perform with<br>
And don't you know that it's just you, hey, Jude, you'll do<br>
The movement you need is on your shoulder<br>
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, yeah<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad<br>
Take a sad song and make it better<br>
Remember to let her under your skin<br>
Then you'll begin to make it<br>
Better, better, better, better, better, better, oh<br>
<br>
