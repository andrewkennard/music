Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine<br>
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all<br>
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?<br>
It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss<br>
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab<br>
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag<br>
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick<br>
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Chest now, he takes off her<br>
Dress now, let me go<br>
And I just can't look; it's killing me<br>
They're taking control<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea<br>
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis<br>
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me<br>
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside<br>
<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
I'm coming out of my cage, and I've been doing just fine<br>
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all<br>
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?<br>
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss<br>
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab<br>
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag<br>
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick<br>
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Chest now, he takes off her<br>
Dress now, let me go<br>
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me<br>
They're taking control<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea<br>
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis<br>
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me<br>
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside<br>

[Outro]<br>
I never...<br>
I never...<br>
I never...<br>
I never...
