Sleigh bells ring<br>
Are you listenin'?<br>
In the lane<br>
Snow is glistenin'<br>
A beautiful sight<br>
We're happy tonight<br>
Walkin' in a winter wonderland<br>
<br>
Gone away is the bluebird<br>
Here to stay is a new bird<br>
He sings a love song<br>
As we go along<br>
Walkin' in a winter wonderland<br>
<br>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown<br>
He'll say: Are you married?<br>
We'll say: "No man<br>
But you can do the job when you're in town"<br>
<br>
Later on<br>
We'll conspire<br>
As we dream by the fire<br>
To face unafraid<br>
The plans that we've made<br>
Walkin' in a winter wonderland<br>
<br>
, Are ya listenin'?<br>
(In the lane), Snow is glissin'<br>
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight<br>
Walkin' in the winter wonderland<br>
<br>
Here to stay is a new bird<br>
He sings a love song<br>
As we go along<br>
Walkin' in a winter wonderland<br>
<br>
In the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
And pretend that he's a circus clown<br>
(We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman)<br>
Yes, until the other kidies knock him down<br>
<br>
Later on, we'll conspire<br>
As we dream by the fire<br>
To face unafraid<br>
The plans that we've made<br>
Walkin' in a winter wonderland<br>
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
