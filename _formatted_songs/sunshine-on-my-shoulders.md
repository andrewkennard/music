Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy<br>
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry<br>
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely<br>
Sunshine almost always makes me high<br>
<br>
If I had a day that I could give you<br>
I'd give to you the day just like today<br>
If I had a song that I could sing for you<br>
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way<br>
<br>
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy<br>
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry<br>
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely<br>
Sunshine almost always makes me high<br>
<br>
If I had a tale that I could tell you<br>
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile<br>
If I had a wish that I could wish for you<br>
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while<br>
<br>
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy<br>
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry<br>
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely<br>
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high<br>
Sunshine almost always
